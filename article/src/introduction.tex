\section{Introduction}

Reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions is important.

What is Eco-driving? \cite{EcodrivingAdvice}
\begin{itemize}
\item Shift up as soon as possible
\item Maintain a steady speed
\item Anticipate traffic flow
\item Decelerate smoothly
\item Avoid idling
\item Avoid pressing the accelerator when switching on engine
\item Minimise additional weight
\item Minimise air resistance
\item Maintain correct tyre pressures
\item Avoid fuel consuming accessories, e.g. air-conditioning
\item Use fuel saving in-car devices as revolution counter and cruise control
\end{itemize}



We aim to identify which factors, available through GPS and CANbus data, has an influence on
fuel consumption and how one explains the difference in the fuel consumption of different
vehicles of the same type?
