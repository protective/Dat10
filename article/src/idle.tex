\section{Avoid Idling}

Avoiding idling or minimising idle time is a factor in eco-driving as fuel is still consumed when the engine is running even though the vehicle is not moving.
The driver is hence consuming unneccesary fuel when idling.

A vehicle is idling when the engines rounds per minute (RPM) is above zero while the speed is zero for at least 50 consecutive recordings. %CHECK
Let $\vrpm$ and $\vspeed$ be the RPM and speed of vehicle $v$ at time $t$, then a vehicle is ideling when
\[\mbox{\textbf{for }} i, \dots ,t, \dots, i+50 \mbox{: }\vrpm> 0 \wedge \vspeed=0 \]
A vehicle must be in idling at least $50$ seconds in order to eliminate involuntary idle times at for example traffic lights or due to small disturbances is the traffic flow.
Figure~\ref{fig:idleDuration} plots a graph of the number of records in which a vehicle is idling at different minimum durations.

Figure~\ref{fig:idleTime} plots the km/l for all trips as a function of how many seconds the vehicle has been idling.
The size of the plot indicates the amount of fuel used in the trip and the color signals what class it has been asigned to.

It might give a more fair result, if the numbers from Figure~\ref{fig:idleTime} are normalised such that the x-axis plots how many percent of the records are an idle state compared to the number of records in the trip.
Figure~\ref{fig:idlePercent} plots the km/l for all trips as a function of how many percent of the trip the vehicle has been idling.
The size of the plot indicates the amount of fuel used in the trip and the color signals what class it has been asigned to.

Figure~\ref{fig:idleClassPercent} abstracts away the actual km/l and only plots the class distibution as a function of he idle percent. 
The purple line indicates how many trips have this idle percentage. 
The graph is cut off at 60 \% because of too little data.
It is evident that the majority of the trips in the \fuelHigh class avoids idling.
