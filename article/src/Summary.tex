\section{Recapitulation}
A treemap over the four vehicles.
Pinpointing where they could improve.
What are the expected savings?

An interesting remark about Figure~\ref{fig:kmlTrips} is that vehicle 40 tends to become more fuel efficient over time and that vehicle 67 becomes slight less fuel efficient over time. 
The reason is unknown.
