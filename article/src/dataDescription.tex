A number of data sources can be used to gather data.
GPS data can easily be collected from any vehicle equiped with a GPS system, through which for example a timestamp, longitude, latitude and speed are available.
CANBus data provides information about the state of the vehicle.  %TODO: Reformulate
Retriving CANBus data is not as easy as GPS data, and little data is therefore avialable. 
CANBus data is for example the engines rounds per minute, fuel consumption and temperature. 
The hauliers may also provide additional information such as vehicle model, capacity and weight. 

Table~\ref{tb:dataDescription} lists the data columns in the provided data set.
The data set contains 10,224,846 records collected from 6 minibusses. 
All vehicles are assumed to be compareable.%TODO

Of the four columns for fuel comsumption, \var{totalconsumed} is the most accurate measure.
The instantaneous values, i.e. \var{actualconsumed} and \var{actual\_km\_l}, is said to be undependable by the data provider and should not be used. 
\var{fuellevel} is fuel level in the tank in percentage (100 \% is full and 0 \% is empty) and \var{totalconsumed} is the amount of fuel consumed.
\var{totalconsumed} does only have a granularity of half a liter, which means it can only be used at an agreegated level of at least a trip in order to get usable results.

Non of the data provided by the haulier is available.
