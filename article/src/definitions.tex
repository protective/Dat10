\section{Defintions}
\subsection{Trips}
The provided data set is annotated with a trip identifier, \tid.
A trip is defined as a collection of records with the same vehicle identifier, \vid, and where each two consecutive records are within 100 seconds of each other.
A trip is hence defined from when the vehicle is turn on and not by when the vehicle is moving when it is possible to map-match GPS coordinates to road segments. 
This defintion is chosen as idle time, i.e. when the engine is running but the vehicle is not moving, is persumed to be an important factor for fuel consumption. 

%TODO: Do tests to explain why 100 seconds

The data set contains 13606 distinct trips containing between 1 and 78511 records.
Many of these trips have less than 100 records and are therefore not useful. %TODO: Do tests to explain why 100 records
We remove these trips which results in 2868 distinct trips. 
The longest trip is 231 km and 278 trips drive less than 1 km.

\subsection{km per liter}
Km per liter is the total number of kilometers driven in the trip divided by the amount of fuel used.
The fuel consumption is extracted from the totalconsumed column which gives the most accurate consumption of the available data.

All six vehicles in the data set have similar km/l accross their trips (See Figure~\ref{fig:kmlTrips}).
Most trips are driven with bewteen 5 and 10 km/l and all have trips with 0 km/l. The latter is because they do not drive any where.

Km per liter can be used as a measure for how fuel efficient the vehicles are.
We classify the trips into three classes based on their km/l.
Class \fuelLow contains trips with between 0 and 4 km/l, being all those that fall below the normal values.
Class \fuelMedium contains trips with between 4 and 8 km/l and class \fuelHigh contains the remaning trips with 8 or more km/l.
The main cluster is split into two classes to distinguish the best trips.
